    These APIs are supported on iOS 7 and later.

    The NSURLSession class and related classes provide an API for downloading content. 
    This API provides a rich set of delegate methods for supporting authentication and gives 
    your app the ability to perform background downloads when your app is not running or, in iOS, 
    while your app is suspended.

        Configuration options for an <Modules.URLSession.Session> object.  
        When a session is created, a copy of the configuration object is made.
        you cannot modify the configuration of a session after it has been created.
     
        The shared session uses the global singleton credential, cache
        and cookie storage objects.
     
        An ephemeral session has no persistent disk storage for cookies,
        cache or credentials.
     
        A background session can be used to perform networking operations
       on behalf of a suspended application, within certain constraints.
